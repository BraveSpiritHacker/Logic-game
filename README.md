## Comment:
The program can be improved if you figure out how to sort out all the possible options for those sitting in the boat. 
In my program, this is represented in the form of sentences that 
the program scans one by one (the order in which they are located is important).
<br/>
The output of the answer in my program happens on recursive descent.
